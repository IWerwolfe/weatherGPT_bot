# Weather Forecast with GPT

## Description

Through this bot, instead of the typical and dull set of numbers, you'll receive a creatively written, and possibly
humorous, weather forecast adapted through a neural network.

For example: "Oh, here comes the time when cheeks turn into crispy cookies, and toe fingers - into funny lollipops! Yes,
friends, it's about Wednesday, January 3, the coldest time of the year when the wind cuts to the bone, and the pressure
drops to a minimum. But don't worry, because we have the moon! Yes, indeed, the waning and calm one, which with its
magnetic field promises us a peaceful night. And what about the morning? In the morning, we expect the same -20 degrees,
so don't forget your warm mittens and nose scarves!"

## How to Run

Coming soon;) still in development.
